# Description

This script is an example of Denial of Service attack scripts. Juggernaut sends obfuscated and
valid get requests to the server which drains its resource pool.
Thus the server will not be able to meet all get requests on time
which will either force the server to throw Resource pool error or
will make the server extremely slow and the webpage will take unbearable
time to load.

The tool contains a user agents text file which ensures that the requests are
different everytime inorder to bypass weak firewalls. Other than that
it also contains a proxy text file which prevents server from blocking a 
specific ip. And the proxy and useragents are selected randlomly so the obfuscation is ensured.


# Requirements
